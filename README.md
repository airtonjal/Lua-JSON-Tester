Lua-JSON-Tester
===============

A tool developed in Lua to test web applications based on REST that rely on the JSON standard

Configuration
=============
  - Add the Lua JSON Tester to your LUA_PATH

Dependencies:
  - [JSON4Lua](http://json.luaforge.net/)
  - [Loop](http://loop.luaforge.net/)
  - Curl
  
I recommend using [LuaRocks](http://json.luaforge.net) to install Lua packages. The scripts/install.sh file is a sample of how to install these dependencies

Tips:
  - If you are having problems using the tool, try setting the DEBUG flag to true on the config.lua file
